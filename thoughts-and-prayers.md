- When implementing the macro, test it with "Expand macro recursively"
- Use the `Fn` Type to check that the given function is pure (note that polymorphic functions have to be handled aswell)
- Error handling should be as comprehensible as possible to the end user (if possible use custom errors, if not, ensure at least that the right part of the code is highlighted)
- How do we hand the `tracing_*` arguments through to other prob functions being called?
  - Simple option: Any function call which takes arguments as a `prob` function would take is transformed during code analysis in the macro (Make `tracing_path` a new-type for that). Problem: How do we handle funky uses of functions?
- Clean up the trace after each iteration? Is this principally necessary or only for performance?
- Implement more informed proposal functions
